Description: Implements methods for processing a sample of (hard)
        clusterings, e.g. the MCMC output of a Bayesian clustering
        model. Among them are methods that find a single best
        clustering to represent the sample, which are based on the
        posterior similarity matrix or a relabelling algorithm.
